# Hello there!
My name is Merkeb Tecle.
I am a future software developer, currently enrolled in the website for beginners at Bitwise Industries. This is our final project but also my first time ever creating a website. I hope to expand my skills through this program. Please contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. I am always willing to learn and get more feedback. 
Thank you & Enjoy!
